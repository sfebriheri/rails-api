- **Shoulda Matchers** - One-liner testing matchers
- **SimpleCov** - Code coverage analysis

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v1/articles_spec.rb

# Run with coverage report
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec
```

### Test Structure

```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### Workflows

1. **Test Job**
   - Sets up Ruby and PostgreSQL
   - Installs dependencies
   - Prepares test database
   - Runs RSpec test suite
   - Generates test coverage reports
   - Uploads test results and coverage artifacts

2. **Lint Job**
   - Runs RuboCop for code style
   - Runs Brakeman for security scanning
   - Runs Bundler Audit for dependency vulnerabilities

### Triggering CI/CD

The pipeline runs automatically on:
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch

## Code Quality Tools

### RuboCop
```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

### Brakeman (Security Scanner)
```bash
bundle exec brakeman
```

### Bundler Audit (Dependency Security)
```bash
bundle exec bundler-audit check --update
```

## Development

### Adding New API Endpoints

1. Generate model and migration
2. Create controller in `app/controllers/api/v1/`
3. Add routes in `config/routes.rb`
4. Create factory in `spec/factories/`
5. Write request specs in `spec/requests/api/v1/`

### Before Committing

```bash
# Run tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run linters
bundle exec rubocop
bundle exec brakeman
```

## Deployment

The application is containerized and ready for deployment. See `Dockerfile` for container configuration.

## Health Check

The API includes a health check endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/up
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

All pull requests must pass CI/CD checks before merging.
