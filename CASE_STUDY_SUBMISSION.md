## 4. Approach & Design (Main Section)

### Initial Plan

When approaching this challenge, I broke down the requirements into core functional areas:

**Primary Requirements Analysis:**
- Document upload and text extraction capabilities
- AI-powered evaluation engine for resumes and portfolios
- Asynchronous job processing for scalability
- RESTful API design for integration flexibility
- Comprehensive scoring and feedback system

**Key Assumptions & Scope Boundaries:**
- PDF documents are the primary input format
- English language content processing
- Single job description comparison per evaluation
- Weighted scoring system with configurable criteria
- Background job processing for performance optimization

### System & Database Design

**API Endpoints Architecture:**
```
POST /api/v1/upload          # Document upload with job title
POST /api/v1/evaluate        # Trigger evaluation process
GET  /api/v1/result/:id      # Retrieve evaluation results
POST /api/v1/job_descriptions # Job description management
GET  /api/v1/job_descriptions # List job descriptions
```

**Database Schema Design:**
```sql
-- Documents table for file storage and metadata
documents:
  - id (primary key)
  - filename (string)
  - file_size (integer)
  - content_type (string)
  - extracted_text (text)
  - processed (boolean)
  - job_title (string)
  - timestamps

-- Evaluation jobs for tracking assessment progress
evaluation_jobs:
  - id (UUID primary key)
  - cv_document_id (foreign key)
  - project_document_id (foreign key)
  - job_title (string)
  - status (enum: queued, processing, completed, failed)
  - cv_match_rate (decimal)
  - cv_feedback (text)
  - project_score (decimal)
  - project_feedback (text)
  - overall_summary (text)
  - timestamps

-- Vector embeddings for future RAG implementation
vector_embeddings:
  - id (primary key)
  - document_id (foreign key)
  - embedding_vector (text)
  - model_name (string)
  - timestamps
```

**Job Queue & Long-Running Task Handling:**
- **Sidekiq** for background job processing
- **Redis** as the job queue backend
- **ExtractTextJob** for PDF text extraction
- **EvaluationWorkerJob** for AI assessment processing
- Asynchronous processing prevents API timeouts
- Job status tracking with UUID-based identification

### LLM Integration

**Provider Selection: OpenAI GPT-4**
- **Reasoning:** Proven performance in text analysis and reasoning tasks
- **Reliability:** Stable API with consistent response quality
- **Context Window:** Large enough for comprehensive document analysis
- **Structured Output:** Good at following JSON response formats

**Prompt Design Strategy:**
The prompting approach uses a structured, multi-criteria evaluation framework:

```ruby
# Core evaluation prompt structure
system_prompt = "You are an expert HR professional and technical recruiter..."

evaluation_criteria = {
  technical_skills: { weight: 0.4, description: "Backend, database, APIs, cloud, AI/LLM expertise" },
  experience_level: { weight: 0.25, description: "Years of experience and project complexity" },
  achievements: { weight: 0.20, description: "Impact of past work and measurable outcomes" },
  collaboration: { weight: 0.15, description: "Communication and teamwork indicators" }
}
```

**Chaining Logic:**
1. **Document Analysis Phase:** Extract key technical skills, experience markers
2. **Criteria Mapping Phase:** Match extracted information to job requirements
3. **Scoring Phase:** Apply weighted scoring algorithm
4. **Feedback Generation Phase:** Create actionable, specific feedback
5. **Summary Phase:** Generate comprehensive assessment overview

**RAG Strategy (Future Implementation):**
- Vector embeddings stored for job description similarity matching
- Semantic search capabilities for skill matching
- Historical evaluation data for consistency improvement
- Knowledge base integration for industry-specific requirements

### Prompting Strategy (Actual Examples)

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an expert HR professional and technical recruiter with 15+ years of experience 
evaluating candidates for software engineering positions. You excel at identifying 
technical competencies, assessing project quality, and providing constructive feedback.

Analyze the provided resume and project report against the job requirements for: {job_title}

Evaluation Criteria (weighted):
1. Technical Skills Match (40%): Backend, database, APIs, cloud, AI/LLM expertise
2. Experience Level (25%): Years of experience and project complexity  
3. Relevant Achievements (20%): Impact of past work and measurable outcomes
4. Cultural/Collaboration Fit (15%): Communication and teamwork indicators

Provide scores (0.0-1.0 for resume, 1-5 for project) and detailed feedback.
```

**User Prompt Template:**
```
JOB TITLE: {job_title}

RESUME CONTENT:
{cv_text}

PROJECT REPORT CONTENT:
{project_text}

Please evaluate this candidate and respond in JSON format with:
- cv_match_rate (0.0-1.0)
- cv_feedback (detailed analysis)
- project_score (1-5)
- project_feedback (specific insights)
- overall_summary (recommendation)
```

### Resilience & Error Handling

**API Failure Management:**
- **Retry Logic:** 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Timeout Handling:** 30-second timeout for LLM API calls
- **Fallback Strategy:** Graceful degradation with partial results
- **Circuit Breaker:** Temporary service disable on repeated failures

**Error Recovery Mechanisms:**
```ruby
# Retry logic implementation
def call_llm_with_retry(prompt, max_retries: 3)
  retries = 0
  begin
    response = llm_service.call(prompt)
    JSON.parse(response)
  rescue => e
    retries += 1
    if retries <= max_retries
      sleep(2 ** retries)
      retry
    else
      handle_llm_failure(e)
    end
  end
end
```

**Randomness Mitigation:**
- **Temperature Setting:** 0.3 for consistent, focused responses
- **Seed Parameter:** Fixed seed for reproducible results during testing
- **Response Validation:** JSON schema validation for structured outputs
- **Fallback Scoring:** Default scoring mechanism if LLM fails

### Edge Cases Considered

**Unusual Input Scenarios:**
1. **Empty/Corrupted PDFs:** Validation and error messaging
2. **Non-English Content:** Language detection and appropriate handling
3. **Extremely Long Documents:** Text truncation with priority sections
4. **Missing Job Descriptions:** Default evaluation criteria application
5. **Malformed File Uploads:** File type and size validation

**Testing Approach:**
```ruby
# Edge case test examples
describe "Document Processing Edge Cases" do
  it "handles corrupted PDF files gracefully"
  it "processes documents with mixed languages"
  it "manages oversized document uploads"
  it "validates file format requirements"
  it "handles concurrent upload scenarios"
end
```

**Concurrent Processing:**
- **Database Locking:** Optimistic locking for evaluation jobs
- **Queue Management:** Job deduplication and priority handling
- **Resource Limits:** Memory and processing time constraints
- **Rate Limiting:** API call throttling to prevent abuse
